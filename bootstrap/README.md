# n3t.uk Vault Cluster Bootstrap Configuration

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a Terraform Configuration which can be used to bootstrap the initial
configuration for a Vault Cluster. Specifically it will:

1. Configure an Auth0 application and connect the Cluster to it via OIDC
   authentication for Single Sign-On access to the Web and CLI interfaces;
1. Configure client-certificate authentication using the n3t.uk Root Certificate
   Authority as the trusted CA for access;
1. Configure basic `adminitrator` and `reader` Roles which both the
   authentication methods above can be permitted to assume.

## Usage

Before running any `plan` or `apply` for Terraform, the following environment
variables are required to authenticate and authorise the creation and management
of the resources inside the Vault Cluster:

| Key                                            | Description                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `n3tuk/auth0/n3tuk/configurator/client-id`     | The Client ID of the machine-to-machine application allowed access to the _Auth0 Management API_                         |
| `n3tuk/auth0/n3tuk/configurator/client-secret` | The Client Secret for the above Client ID allowed access to the _Auth0 Management API_                                   |
| `n3tuk/vault/vault.{e}.{region}.kub3.uk/root`  | The `root` Vault Token created during the initlisation of the `{environment}` Cluster and used to configure the baseline |

```console
