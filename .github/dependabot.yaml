version: 2

# For both Terraform modules and Terraform configurations, the checks performed
# by Dependabot are distributed across the week to give time for the checks to
# be made, reviewed, and merged, and then (if required) new releases made, which
# in turn will allow the following updates to take these releases into account.
#
# Friday:
#   - 12:00 GitHub Actions
#   - 18:00 Sub-modules in Terraform modules (if present)
# Saturday:
#   - 18:00 Modules in Terraform modules
# Sunday:
#   - 18:00 Examples in Terraform modules (if present)
#        or Terraform Configurations
#
#           Examples and configurations are delayed as some updates can be
#           duplicate the updated made through the module in Terraform module
#           update above, so this will reduce the chances of duplicated, and
#           hence redundant, pull requests being made by Dependabot.
